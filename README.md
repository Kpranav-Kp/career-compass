- ### Request Format

  **Method:** `POST`  
  **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`  
  **Authentication:** Not required (Public endpoint)

- **Parameters:**

  | Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                                   |

- ### How It Works

  1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from your resume
  2. **AI Skill Parsing**: OpenRouter AI (Mistral-7B model) analyzes the text and identifies technical and soft skills
  3. **Context Understanding**: Recognizes skills mentioned in project descriptions, work experience, and coursework
  4. **Role Matching**: If you provide a target role, AI recommends additional skills needed for that position
  5. **Deduplication**: Filters out recommended skills you already have

- ### Tips for Best Results

  ‚úÖ **Resume Format**: Use standard resume formats with clear sections  
  ‚úÖ **File Size**: Keep resume under 5MB  
  ‚úÖ **Content**: Include project descriptions, work experience, and technical skills section  
  ‚úÖ **Target Role**: Specify your desired role for personalized recommendations

- ### Extraction Issues

  The API may return an `extraction_issue` field with these values:

  | Issue             | Meaning                               | Solution                                             |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | `null`            | No issues, extraction successful      | -                                                    |
  | `bad_read`        | Failed to extract text from PDF       | Try a different PDF format or regenerate your resume |
  | `input_too_long`  | Resume text exceeds 50,000 characters | Shorten your resume to 2-3 pages                     |
  | `no_skills_found` | AI couldn't identify skills in resume | Add a dedicated "Skills" section to your resume      |
